# MemoryWeaver – Your Personalized Recall Engine

**Submission Date:** April 22, 2025

## Overview

MemoryWeaver is a personalized AI recall agent designed to retrieve past insights, quotes, documents, and moments from across the Microsoft 365 ecosystem — no matter how long ago. Built with **Microsoft Copilot Studio**, **Azure AI**, and **Power Automate**, this no-code agent is fully functional and demo-ready.

## Features

- Recall work from emails, meetings, files, or chats — even from years ago.
- Ask natural questions like “What did I say about GenAI last April?”
- Retrieves and displays title, date, source, and content instantly.
- Built entirely with Microsoft’s agentic framework — no coding required.
- Fully deployed in Copilot Studio, working end-to-end.

## Architecture

- **Copilot Studio:** Conversational agent frontend
- **Azure AI Services:** Semantic ranker for memory search
- **Power Automate:** Integrates semantic search logic + APIs
- **Microsoft 365:** Connects to Word, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams chat

## Important Notes

This demo uses **sample data only**. Since this was built in a new Microsoft 365 tenant, no historic data was available. All data (emails, files, chats, etc.) shown in the demo were manually generated to simulate real-world interactions.

However, the agent is fully functional and can be easily extended to real users in production via Microsoft Graph APIs.

Here are 20 prompts you can try in the demo:

1. What did I say about GenAI in the keynote last April?
